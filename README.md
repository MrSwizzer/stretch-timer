A small WebApp Timer for Stretching.
When you oush "Start stretching" it counts down from 10 to get into position.
After the 10 seconds a sounds gets played indicating it's now time to hold the stretch.
It then counts down from 30 seconds for the stretch.
After the 30 seconds another sounds gets played indicating the stretch is done and it's time to get into the next position.
This process gets repeated until you oush the "Stop stretching" Button.
